## 🦸‍♂️ Overview

Welcome to the **BuckleUpGenius Portfolio**. This isn't just a portfolio; it's a visual narrative. Designed with a distinct "Comic Book / Superhero" aesthetic, this website combines bold visuals, interactive storytelling, and high-performance immersive animations to showcase creative work.

Built with modern web technologies, it features dynamic page transitions, custom cursors, and a unique "Issue" based project viewer that mimics the tactile feel of reading a comic.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🎨 Comic Book Aesthetic**: Heavy use of Ben-Day dots, bold black outlines, vibrant primary colors, and skewed layouts.
-   **🖱️ Custom Interactive Cursor**: A Lottie-based animated cursor with a trailing ink splatter effect that reacts to user interaction.
-   **📱 Fully Responsive**: Optimized for all devices, with specific mobile-first layouts and touch interactions (including swipe gestures).
-   **🔄 Dynamic Project Viewer**:
    -   **Flip Mode**: A horizontal scrolling experience mimicking comic pages.
    -   **Grid Mode**: A classic overview of all works.
-   **🎭 Immersive Animations**: Powered by **Framer Motion** for smooth entrances, scroll-triggered reveals, and spring physics.
-   **🚧 Custom Status Pages**: Dedicated "Under Construction" and "404 Not Found" pages with immersive video loops.
